# Multinomial Regression(MNR)
For this repository my attempt is to model MNR for iris data-set and find the decision boundaries for this model.  I used softmax activation function, find the cross entropy and average cross entropy, and use backtracking method to find the best learning rate.  When my model created, I regularized the model which is a technique to prevent the model from overfitting by adding extra information to it. Finally I use Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) which is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties and compare it with simple Gradient Descent.
